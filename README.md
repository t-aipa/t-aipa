# About me.


**t-aipa/t-aipa** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Iâ€™m currently learning about intelligence. Why is there a divide between natural and artificial intelligence? What are their similarities and limitations?
  
- ðŸ‘¯ What is intelligence? What is its origin? How does it manifest? is it Conditional or Situational? Is it Physical? Psychological? Is it Natural? Is it material or superficial and artificial? Or Sensational? Who senses intelligence or can any one realise or posses it?
  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to build an AI application model and to build upon such intelligence with tools or fine tuning.
- ðŸ¤” I need help from the foundation of the app, getting a template/UI and API with Cohere models.
